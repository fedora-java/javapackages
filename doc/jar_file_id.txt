Complex Java applications usually consist of multiple components.
Each component can have multiple implementations, called _artifacts_.
Artifacts in java context are _usually_ JAR files, but can also be WAR
files or any other kind of file.

There exist multiple incompatible ways of identifying (naming) Java
artifacts and each build system often encourages usage of specific
naming scheme.  This means that Linux distributions also need to allow
each artifact to be located using several different identifiers,
possible using different schemes.  On the other hand it is virtually
impossible to every naming scheme, so there are some simplifications.

This chapter describes artifact different ways to identify and locate
artifacts in system repository.
