[quote,,from Gradle package description]
______
Gradle combines the power and flexibility of Ant with the dependency
management and conventions of Maven into a more effective way to
build.  Powered by a Groovy DSL and packed with innovation, Gradle
provides a declarative way to describe all kinds of builds through
sensible defaults.  Gradle is quickly becoming the build system of
choice for many open source projects, leading edge enterprises and
legacy automation challenges.

Gradle is quickly gaining popularity as flexible Java build system,
which can be used in situations requiring writing custom build logic.
Flexibility means that Gradle build scripts can differ significantly
across different projects and there is no universal way of packaging
Gradle projects.  However, in most common situations the following
steps can are necessary:

1. Add build-dependency on `gradle-local`
2. In the `%build` section of the spec use `%gradle_build` macro to
   invoke Gradle in local, offline mode to build the project
3. In the `%install` section, use `%mvn_install` macro to install
   Maven artifacts produced during build
4. Use generated file `.mfiles` lists to populate `%files` section
   with `-f` switch

.Common spec file sections
[source,spec]
--------
BuildRequires:  gradle-local
...

%build
%gradle_build

%install
%mvn_install -J ...

%files -f .mfiles

%files javadoc -f .mfiles-javadoc
-------


`%gradle_local` macro is very similar to `%mvn_build` and it
takes the same arguments.  It is a wrapper for `gradle` command which
enables so called "local mode" of artifact resolution - dependency
artifacts are resolved from local system before trying other
repositories (system Maven repositories are used through XMvn).  By
default `%gradle_local` invokes Gradle with `build` goal, but when
tests are skipped (option `-f`) then `assemble` goal is invoked
instead.

In most simple cases calling `%gradle_local` should be enough to
resolve all dependencies, but sometimes additional patching of build
script may be necessary.  The following example patch adds XMvn
resolver to make Gradle correctly resolve dependencies of build script
itself.

Once Gradle build completes, all Maven artifacts produced by the build
will be marked for installation.  `%mvn_install` macro, which should
be called from the `%install` section of spec file, automatically
handles installation of all marked artifacts and generates `.mfiles`
file lists, which are used to define package contents through `%file`
sections.  If you are building Javadocs (recommended) then you should
call `%mvn_install` with `-J` argument pointing to directory
containing generated Javadoc documentation.

Most of Maven macros starting with `%mvn_` can also be used when
building packages with Gradle.  This includes macros that control
which artifacts should be installed where and how (`%mvn_package`,
`%mvn_alias`, `%mvn_file`, `%mvn_compat_version`), `%mvn_artifact`
that is used to mark additional artifacts as installable and
`%mvn_config` which can be used to add extra config for XMvn.
