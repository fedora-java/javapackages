Javadoc subpackages in Fedora provide automatically generated API
documentation for Java libraries and applications. <<openjdk,Java
Development Kit>> comes with tool called `javadoc`. This tool can be
used for generating the documentation from specially formated comments
in Java source files.  Output of this tool, together with license files,
usually represents only content of javadoc subpackages. Note `javadoc`
invocation is typically handled by build system and package maintainer
doesn't need to deal with it directly.

Javadoc subpackage shouldn't depend on its base package and vice versa.
The rationale behind this rule is that documentation can usually be used
independently from application/library and therefore base package
doesn't need to be always installed. Users are given an option to
install application and documentation separately.
