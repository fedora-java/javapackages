Handling of compatibility packages, versioned jars etc.

WORK IN PROGRESS
msimacek, 2015-04-02

In Fedora we prefer to always have only the latest version of a given
project. Unfortunately, this is not always possible as some projects
change too much and it would be too hard to port dependent packages to
the current version.  It's not possible to just update the package and
keep the old version around as the names, file paths and dependency
provides would clash.  The recommended practice is to update the current
package to the new version and create new package representing the old
version (called compat package). The compat package needs to have the
version number (usually only the major number, unless further
distinction is necessary) appended to the name, thus effectivelly having
different name from RPM's point of view. Such compat package needs to
perform some additional steps to ensure that it can be installed and
used along the non-compat one.

[NOTE]
======
You should always evaluate whether creating a compat package is really
necessary. Porting dependent projects to new versions of dependencies
may be a compicated task, but your effort would be appreciated and it's
likely that the patch will be accepted upstream at some point in time.
If the upstream is already inactive and the package is not required by
anything, you should also consider retiring it.

===== Maven Compat Versions
XMvn supports marking particular artifact as compat, performing the
necessary steps to avoid clashes with the non-compat version. An
artifact can be marked as compat by `%mvn_compat_version`. It accepts an
artifact argument which will determine which artifact will be compat.
The format for specifying artifact coordinates is the same as with
<<mvn_alias,`%mvn_alias`>>. In the common case you will want to mark all
artifacts as compat. You can specify multiple compat versions at a time.

.Dependency resolution of compat artifacts
When XMvn performs dependency resolution for a dependency artifact in
a project, it checks the dependency version and compares it against all
versions of the artifact installed in the buildroot. If none of the
compat artifacts matches it will resolve the artifact to the non-compat
one. This has a few implications:

- The versions are compared for exact match. The compat package should
  provide all applicable versions that are present in packages that
  are supposed to be used with this version.
- The dependent packages need to have correct BuildRequires on the
  compat package as the virtual provides is also different (see below).

.File names and virtual provides
In order to prevent file name clashes, compat artifacts have the first
specified compat version appended to the filename. Virtual provides for
compat artifacts also contain the version as the last part of the
coordinates. There are multiple provides for each specified compat
version. Non-compat artifact don't have any version in the virtual
provides.

.Example invocation of `%mvn_compat_version`
[source,shell]
--------------
# Assuming the package has name bar and version 3
# Sets the compat version of foo:bar artifact to 3
%mvn_compat_version foo:bar 3
# The installed artifact file (assuming it's jar and there were no
# %mvn_file calls) will be at %{_javadir}/bar/bar-3.jar
# The generated provides for foo:bar will be
# mvn(foo:bar:3) = 3
# mvn(foo:bar:pom:3) = 3

# Sets the compat versions of all artifacts in the build to 3 and 3.2
%mvn_compat_version : 3 3.2
