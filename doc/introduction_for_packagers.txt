Java is a programming language which is usually compiled into bytecode for JVM
(Java Virtual Machine). For more details about the JVM and bytecode
specification see
link:http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/index.html[JVM
documentation].


==== Example Java Project
To better illustrate various parts of Java packaging we will dissect simple Java
``Hello world'' application. Java sources are usually organized using directory
hierarchies. Shared directory hierarchy creates a namespace called `package` in
Java terminology. To understand naming mechanisms of Java `packages` see
link:http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/package/namingpkgs.html[Java
package naming conventions].

Let's create a simple hello world application that will execute following steps
when run:

 1. Ask for a name
 2. Print out ``Hello World from'' and the name from previous step

To illustrate certain points we artificially complicate things by creating:

 - `Input` class used only for input of text from terminal
 - `Output` class used only for output on terminal
 - `HelloWorldApp` class used as main application

.Directory listing of example project
[source,shell]
------
$ find .
.
./Makefile
./src
./src/org
./src/org/fedoraproject
./src/org/fedoraproject/helloworld
./src/org/fedoraproject/helloworld/output
./src/org/fedoraproject/helloworld/output/Output.java
./src/org/fedoraproject/helloworld/input
./src/org/fedoraproject/helloworld/input/Input.java
./src/org/fedoraproject/helloworld/HelloWorld.java
------

In this project all packages are under `src/` directory hierarchy.

.HelloWorld.java listing
[source,java]
------
include::java_project/src/org/fedoraproject/helloworld/HelloWorld.java[]
------



.Java packages
[source,shell]
------
org/fedoraproject/helloworld/input/Input.java
org/fedoraproject/helloworld/output/Output.java
org/fedoraproject/helloworld/HelloWorld.java
------

Although the directory structure of our package is hierarchical, there
is no real parent-child relationship between packages. Each package is
therefore seen as independent.
Above example makes use of three separate packages:

 - `org.fedoraproject.helloworld.input`
 - `org.fedoraproject.helloworld.output`
 - `org.fedoraproject.helloworld`

Environment setup consists of two main parts:

 - Telling JVM which Java class contains `main()` method
 - Adding required JAR files on JVM classpath

.Compiling our project
The sample project can be compiled to a bytecode by Java compiler. Java
compiler can be typically invoked from command line by command `javac`.

[source,shell]
------
$ javac `find . -name *.java`
------

For every `.java` file corresponding `.class` file will be created. The
`.class` files contain Java bytecode which is meant to be executed on
JVM.

One could put invocation of `javac` to Makefile and simplify the
compilation a bit. It might be sufficient for such a simple project, but
it would quickly become hard to build more complex projects with this
approach. Java world knows several high-level build systems which can
highly simplify building of Java projects. Among the others, probably
most known are http://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven],
http://ant.apache.org/[Apache Ant] and http://www.gradle.org/[Gradle].

.JAR files
Having our application split across many `.class` files wouldn't be very
practical, so those `.class` files are assembled into ZIP files with
specific layout called JAR files. Most commonly these special ZIP files
have `.jar` suffix, but other variations exist (`.war`, `.ear`). They
contain:

  * Compiled bytecode of our project
  * Additional metadata stored in `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file
  * Resource files such as images or localisation data
  * Optionaly the source code of our project (called source JAR then)

They can also contain additional bundled software which is something
we don't want to have in packages. You can inspect the contents of given
JAR file by extracting it. That can be done with following command:

[source,shell]
------
jar xf something.jar
------

The detailed description of JAR file format is in the
link:http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jar.html[JAR File
Specification].

.Classpath

The classpath is a way of telling JVM where to look for user classes
and 3rd party libraries. By default, only current directory is searched,
all other locations need to be specified explicitly by setting up
CLASSPATH environment variable, or via `-cp` (`-classpath`) option of a
Java Virtual Machine.

.Setting the classpath
[source,shell]
------
java -cp /usr/share/java/log4j.jar:/usr/share/java/junit.jar mypackage/MyClass.class
CLASSPATH=/usr/share/java/log4j.jar:/usr/share/java/junit.jar java mypackage/MyClass.class
------

Please note that two JAR files are separated by colon in a classpath
definition.

[TIP]
======
See
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/windows/classpath.html[official
documentation] for more information about classpath.
======

.Wrapper scripts

Classic compiled applications use dynamic linker to find dependencies (linked
libraries), Python interpreter has predefined directories where it searches for
imported modules. JVM itself has no embedded knowledge of installation paths and
thus no automatic way to resolve dependencies of Java projects. This means that
all Java applications have to use wrapper shell scripts to setup the environment
before invoking the JVM and running the application itself. Note that this is
not necessary for libraries.


==== Build System Identification
Build system used by upstream can be usually identified by looking at
their configuration files, which reside in project directory structure,
usually in its root or in specialized directories with names such as
`build` or `make`.


.Maven
Build managed by Apache Maven is configured by an XML file that is by
default named `pom.xml`. In its simpler form it usually looks like this:

[source, xml]
-------------
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
                             http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <groupId>com.example.myproject</groupId>
    <artifactId>myproject</artifactId>
    <packaging>jar</packaging>
    <version>1.0</version>
    <name>myproject</name>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>junit</groupId>
            <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
            <version>4.1</version>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</project>
---------


It describes project's build process in a declarative way, without
explicitly specifying exact steps needed to compile sources and assemble
pieces together. It also specifies project's dependencies which are
usually the main point of interest for packagers. Other important
feature of Maven that packagers should know about are plugins. Plugins
extend Maven with some particular functionality, but unfortunately some
of them may get in the way of packaging and need to be altered or
removed. There are RPM macros provided to facilitate modifying Maven
dependencies and plugins.


.Ant
Apache Ant is also configured by an XML file. It is by convention named
`build.xml` and in its simple form it looks like this:

[source, xml]
-------------
<project name="MyProject" default="dist" basedir=".">
  <property name="src" location="src"/>
  <property name="build" location="build"/>
  <property name="dist" location="dist"/>

  <target name="init" description="Create build directory">
    <mkdir dir="${build}"/>
  </target>

  <target name="compile" depends="init"
        description="Compile the source">
    <javac srcdir="${src}" destdir="${build}"/>
  </target>

  <target name="dist" depends="compile"
        description="Generate jar">
    <mkdir dir="${dist}/lib"/>

    <jar jarfile="${dist}/myproject.jar" basedir="${build}"/>
  </target>

  <target name="clean" description="Clean build files">
    <delete dir="${build}"/>
    <delete dir="${dist}"/>
  </target>
</project>
----------


Ant build file consists mostly of targets, which are collections of
steps needed to accomplish intended task. They usually depend on each
other and are generally similar to Makefile targets. Available targets
can be listed by invoking `ant -p` in project directory containing
`build.xml` file. If the file is named differently than `build.xml` you
have to tell Ant which file should be used by using `-f` option with the
name of the actual build file.


.Gradle
Gradle is configured by a script written in Groovy (dynamic language
built on top of JVM and extending Java's syntax). It's configuration
file is `build.gradle`.

[source, java]
----------------
apply plugin: 'java'

task customJar(type: Jar) {
  archiveName = 'myproject.jar'
  destinationDir = file("${buildDir}/jars")
  from sourceSets.main.output
}
----------------


.Make
While unlikely, it's still possible that you encounter a project whose
build is managed by plain old Makefiles. They contain a list of targets
which consist of commands (marked with tab at the begining of line) and
are invoked by `make` _target_ or simply `make` to run the default
target.


==== Quiz for Packagers
At this point you should have enough knowledge about Java to start
packaging. If you are not able to answer following questions return back to
previous sections or ask experienced packagers for different explanations of
given topics.

1. What is the difference between JVM and Java?
2. What is a CLASSPATH environment variable and how can you use it?
3. Name two typical Java build systems and how you can identify which one is being used
4. What is the difference between `java` and `javac` comands?
5. What are contents of a typical `JAR` file?
6. What is a pom.xml file and what information it contains?
7. How would you handle packaging software that contains `lib/junit4.jar` inside
   source tarball?
8. Name at least three methods for bundling code in Java projects
