Packaging Java software has specifics which we will try to cover in this section
aimed at Java developers who are already familiar with Java language, JVM,
classpath handling, Maven, pom.xml file structure and dependencies.

Instead we will focus on basic packaging tools and relationships between Java
and RPM world. One of the most important questions is: What is the reason to
package software in RPM (or other distribution-specific formats). There are
several reasons for it, among others:

  - Unified way of installation of software for users of distribution regardless
    of upstream projects
  - Verification of authenticity of software packages by signing them
  - Simplified software updates
  - Automatic handling of dependencies for users
  - Common filesystem layout across distribution enforced by packaging standards
  - Ability to administer, monitor and query packages installed on several
    machines through unified interfaces
  - Distribution of additional metadata with the software itself such as
    licenses used, homepage for the project, changelogs and other information
    that users or administrators can find useful

==== Example RPM Project
RPM uses `spec` files as recipes for building software packages.  We
will use it to package example project created in previous section. If
you didn't read it you don't need to; the file listing is available here
and the rest is not necessary for this section.

.Directory listing
[source,shell]
------
Makefile
src
src/org
src/org/fedoraproject
src/org/fedoraproject/helloworld
src/org/fedoraproject/helloworld/output
src/org/fedoraproject/helloworld/output/Output.java
src/org/fedoraproject/helloworld/input
src/org/fedoraproject/helloworld/input/Input.java
src/org/fedoraproject/helloworld/HelloWorld.java
------

We packed the project directory into file `helloworld.tar.gz`.

.Example spec file
[source,spec,numbered]
------
include::rpm_project/helloworld.spec[]
------

RPM `spec` files contain several basic sections:

Header, which contains: ::
   * Package metadata such as its name, version, release,
     license...
   * A `Summary` with basic one-line summary of package contents
   * Package source URLs denoted with `Source0` to `SourceN` directives
   ** Source files can then be referenced by `%SOURCE0` to
      `%SOURCEn`, which expand to actual paths to given files
   ** In practice, the source URL shouldn't point to a file in our
      filesystem, but to an upstream release on the web
   * Patches - using `Patch0` to `PatchN`
   * Project dependencies
   ** Build dependencies specified by `BuildRequires`, which need to be
      determined manually.
   ** Run time dependencies will be detected automatically. If it fails,
      you have to specify them with `Requires`.
   ** More information on this topic can be found in
      <<dependency_handling,Dependency handling>> section.


Description::
   * Few sentences about the project and its uses. It will be displayed
     by package management software.

Prep section::
   * Unpacks the sources using `setup -q` or manually if needed
   * If a source file doesn't need to be extracted, it can be copied
     to build directory by `cp -p %SOURCE0 .`
   * Apply patches with `%patchX`, where X is the number of patch you
     want to apply. (You usually need the patch index, so it would be:
     `%patch0 -p1`)

Build section::
   * Contains project compilation instructions. Usually consists of
     calling the projects build system such as Ant, Maven or Make.

Optional `%check` section::
   * Runs projects integration tests. Unit test are usually run in
     `%build` section, so if there are no integration tests available,
     this section is omitted

Install section::
   * Copies built files that are supposed to be installed into
     `%{buildroot}` directory, which represents target filesystem's root

Files section::
   * Lists all files, that should be installed from `%{buildroot}` to
     target system.
   * Documentation files are prefixed by `%doc` and are
     taken from build directory instead of buildroot
   * Directories that this package should own are prefixed with `%dir`

Changelog::
   * Contains changes to this spec file (not upstream)
   * Has prescribed format. To prevent mistakes in format, it is
     advised to use tool such as `rpmdev-bumpspec` from package rpmdevtools to
     append new changelog entries instead of editing it by hand


To build RPM from link:rpm_project/helloworld.spec[this `spec` file] save it in
your current directory and run `rpmbuild`:
[source,shell]
------
$ rpmbuild -bb helloworld.spec
------

If everything worked OK, this should produce RPM file
`~/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/helloworld-1.0-1.fc18.x86_64.rpm`. You can use
`rpm -i` or `dnf install` commands to install this package and it
will add `/usr/share/java/helloworld.jar` and `/usr/bin/helloworld`
wrapper script to your system. Please note that this specfile is
simplified and lacks some additional parts, such as license
installation.

[NOTE]
======
Paths and filenames might be slightly different depending on your architecture
and distribution. Output of the commands will tell you exact paths
======

As you can see to build RPM files you can use `rpmbuild` command. It has several
other options, which we will cover later on.

Except building binary RPMs (`-bb`), `rpmbuild` can also be told to:

 - build only source RPMs (SRPMs), the packages containing source files
   which can be later build to RPMs (option `-bs`)
 - build all, both binary and source RPMs (option `-ba`)

See `rpmbuild`'s manual page for all available options.

[[querying_repositories]]
==== Querying repositories

Fedora comes with several useful tools which can provide great
assistance in getting information from RPM repositories.

`dnf repoquery` is a tool for querying information from RPM repositories.
Maintainer of Java packages might typically query the repository for
information like "which package contains Maven artifact
`groupId:artifactId`".

.Find out which package provides given artifact
[source,shell]
------
$ dnf repoquery --whatprovides 'mvn(commons-io:commons-io)'
apache-commons-io-1:2.4-9.fc19.noarch
------

The example above shows that one can get to `commons-io:commons-io`
artifact by installing `apache-commons-io` package.

By default, `dnf repoquery` uses all enabled repositories in DNF
configuration, but it is possible to explicitly specify any other
repository. For example following command will query only Rawhide
repository:

[source,shell]
------
$ dnf repoquery --available --disablerepo \* --enablerepo rawhide --whatprovides 'mvn(commons-io:commons-io)'
apache-commons-io-1:2.4-10.fc20.noarch
------

Sometimes it may be useful to just list all the artifacts provided by
given package:

[source,shell]
------
$ dnf repoquery --provides apache-commons-io
apache-commons-io = 1:2.4-9.fc19
jakarta-commons-io = 1:2.4-9.fc19
mvn(commons-io:commons-io) = 2.4
mvn(org.apache.commons:commons-io) = 2.4
osgi(org.apache.commons.io) = 2.4.0
------

Output above means that package `apache-commons-io` provides two Maven
artifacts: previously mentioned `commons-io:commons-io` and
`org.apache.commons:commons-io`. In this case the second one is just an
alias for same JAR file. See section about <<aliases,artifact aliases>>
for more information on this topic.

Another useful tool is `rpm`. It can do a lot of stuff, but most
importantly it can replace `dnf repoquery` if one only needs to query local
RPM database. Only installed packages, or local `.rpm` files, can be
queried with this tool.

Common use case could be checking which Maven artifacts provide locally
built packages.

[source,shell]
------
$ rpm -qp --provides simplemaven-1.0-2.fc21.noarch.rpm
mvn(com.example:simplemaven) = 1.0
mvn(simplemaven:simplemaven) = 1.0
simplemaven = 1.0-2.fc21
------
