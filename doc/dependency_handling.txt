WORK IN PROGRESS

Describe RPM Provides and Requires, their interactions especially with relation
to JAR file identification, explain mvn(gId:aId...) strings.

RPM has multiple types of metadata to describe dependency relationships
between packages. The two basic types are Requires and Provides.
Requires denote that a package needs something to be present at
runtime to work correctly and the package manager is supposed to ensure
that requires are met. A single Requires item can specify a package or
a virtual provide.
RPM Provides are a way to express that a package provides certain
capability that other packages might need. In case of Maven packages,
the Provides are used to denote that a package contains certain Maven
artifact. They add more flexibility to
the dependency management as single package can have any number of
provides, and they can be moved across different packages without
breaking other packages' requires.
Provides are usually generated by automatic tools based on the
information from the built binaries or package source.

.Dependency handling for Maven packages
The Java packaging tooling on Fedora provides automatic Requires and
Provides generation for packages built using XMvn. The Provides are based
on Maven artifact coordinates of artifacts that were installed by the
currenlty being built. They are generated for each subpackage
separately. They follow a general format
`mvn(groupId:artifactId:extension:classifier:version)`, where the
extension is omitted if it's `jar` and classifier is omitted if empty.
Version is present only for compat artifacts, but the trailing colon has
to be present unless it's a Jar artifact with no classifier.

--------------
# Example provide for Jar artifact
mvn(org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-server)
# Example provide for POM artifact
mvn(org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-parent:pom:)
# Example provide for Jar artifact with classifier
mvn(org.sonatype.sisu:sisu-guice::no_aop:)
--------------

The generated Requires are based on dependencies specified in Maven POMs
in the project. Only dependencies with `scope` set to either `compile`,
`runtime` or not set at all are used for Requires generation.
Requires don't rely on package names and instead always
use virtual provides that were described above, in exactly the same
format, in order to be satisfieable by the already existing provides.
For packages consisting of multiple subpackages, Requires are generated
separately for each subpackage. Additionally, Requires that point to an
artifact in a different subpackage of the same source package are
generated with exact versions to prevent version mismatches between
artifacts belonging to the same project.

The requires generator also always generates Requires on `java-headless`
and `javapackages-tools`.

.Dependency handling for non-Maven packages that ship POM files
If the package is built built using different tool than Apache Maven,
but still ships Maven POM(s), the you will still get automatic provides
generation if you install the POM using `%mvn_artifact` and
`%mvn_install`. The requires generation will also be executed but the
outcome largely depends on whether the POM contains accurate dependency
insformation. If it contains dependency information, you should double
check that it's correct and up-to-date. Otherwise you need to add
`Requires` tags manually as described in the next section.

.Dependency handling for non-Maven packages that don't ship POM files
For packages without POMs it's necessary to specify `Requires` tags
manually. In order to build the package you needed to specify
`BuildRequires` tags. You `Requires` tags will therefore likely be
a subset of your `BuildRequires`, excluding build tools and test only
dependencies.

.Querying Requires and Provides of built packages
The generated Requires and Provides of built packages can be queried
using `rpm`:
[source,shell]
--------------
rpm -qp --provides path/to/example-1.0.noarch.rpm
rpm -qp --requires path/to/example-1.0.noarch.rpm
-------------

.Generating BuildRequires
While Requires and Provides are automated for Maven projects,
BuildRequires still remain a manual task. However, it can be at least
a bit simplified. XMvn ships a script `xmvn-builddep` that takes
a `build.log` output from mock and prints maven-style BuildRequires on
artifacts that were actually used during the build. It doesn't help you
to figure out what the BuildRequires are before you actually build it,
but it may help you to have a minimal set of BuildRequires that are less
likely to break, as they don't rely on transitive dependencies.
