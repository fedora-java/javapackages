This section describes most of directories used for Java packaging.
Each directory is named in RPM macro form, which shows how it should
be used in RPM spec files.  Symbolic name is followed by usual macro
expansion (i.e. physical directory location in the file system) and
short description.

.Directories commonly used by regular packages
[glossary]
*`%{_javadir}`* -- `/usr/share/java`::

    Directory that holds all JAR files that do not contain or use
    native code and do not depend on a particular Java standard
    version.  JAR files can either be placed directly in this
    directory or one of its subdirectories.  Often packages create
    their own subdirectories there, in this case subdirectory name
    should match package name.

*`%{_jnidir}`* -- `/usr/lib/java`::

    Directory where architecture-specific JAR files are installed.  In
    particular JAR files containing or using native code (Java Native
    Interface, NI) should be installed.

*`%{_javadocdir}`* -- `/usr/share/javadoc`::

    Root directory where all Java API documentation (Javadoc) is
    installed.  Each source package usually creates a single
    subdirectory containing aggregated Javadocs for all binary
    packages it produces.

*`%{_mavenpomdir}`* -- `/usr/share/maven-poms`::

    Directory where Project Object Model (POM) files used by Apache
    Maven are installed.  Each POM must have name that strictly
    corresponds to JAR file in `%{_javadir}` or `%{_jnidir}`.


.Other directories
[glossary]
*`%{_jvmdir}`* -- `/usr/lib/jvm`::

    Root directory where different Java Virtual Machines (JVM) are
    installed.  Each JVM creates a subdirectory, possibly with several
    alternative names implemented with symbolic links.  Directories
    prefixed with `java` contain Java Development Kit (JDK), while
    directories which names start with `jre` hold Java Runtime
    Environment (JRE).

*`%{_jvmsysconfdir}`* -- `/etc/jvm`::
*`%{_jvmcommonsysconfdir}`* -- `/etc/jvm-common`::

    Directories containing configuration files for Java Virtual
    Machines (JVM).

*`%{_jvmprivdir}`* -- `/usr/lib/jvm-private`::
*`%{_jvmlibdir}`* -- `/usr/lib/jvm`::
*`%{_jvmdatadir}`* -- `/usr/share/jvm`::
*`%{_jvmcommonlibdir}`* -- `/usr/lib/jvm-common`::
*`%{_jvmcommondatadir}`* -- `/usr/share/jvm-common`::

    Directories containing implementation files of Java Virtual
    Machines (JVM).  Describing them in detail is out of scope for
    this document.  Purpose of each directory is commented briefly in
    `macros.jpackage` file in `/etc/rpm`.  More detailed description
    can be found in JPackage policy.

*`%{_javaconfdir}`* -- `/etc/java`::

    Directory containing Java configuration files.  In particular it
    contains main Java configuration file -- `java.conf`.
