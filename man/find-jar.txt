NAME
----
find-jar - find extension JAR or directory

SYNOPSIS
--------
*find-jar* element

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *find-jar* command tests the resolution of a given element.  If
successful it will return a JAR file or a directory.

This command is solely intended for testing resolution and should not
be used in scripts.  Even for single-element classpath building
*build-classpath* is preferred since single-element searches can
produce multiple file results when resolving into a directory.

EXAMPLES
--------
*find-jar xpp3* will print */usr/share/java/xpp3.jar* on standard
output.

*find-jar javamail* will print */usr/share/java/javamail* on standard
output.
