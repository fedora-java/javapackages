NAME
----
pom_xpath_set - set contents of XML node from XML file

SYNOPSIS
--------
*%pom_xpath_set* XPath new-contents [XML-file-location]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This macro patches specified POM file replacing contents of all
XML nodes described by the XPath expression with given new text
content. This works on both elements and attributes.

XPath is an expression describing a set of XML nodes to be removed
from the POM file.  It must be a properly formated XPath 1.0
expression, as described in http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/.

Maven POM files use specific XML namespace
`http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0` as default. This namespace needs to
be explicitly specified in XPath expressions by prefixing all node names
with *pom* (i.e. *pom:modelVersion*).

Many other XML formats also use namespaces which you have to explicitly
specify. This script will use the namespace prefix names from the
*xmlns* declarations in the document's root element. So if the document
begins with `<root xmlns:my="myurl.com">` you would select the root node
with XPath expression */my:root*. If the document specifies a default
namespace (eg `xmlns="myurl.com"`) use the prefix named *default* to
acces elements in that namespace.

XML location can be either a full path to the XML, or a path to the
directory containing *pom.xml* or *ivy.xml*.  If XML location is not
given then *pom.xml* or *ivy.xml* from current working directory is
used. When both *pom.xml* and *ivy.xml* are present, *pom.xml* is
processed. You can specify more file locations.
