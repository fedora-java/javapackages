NAME
----
pom_xpath_remove - remove a node from XML file

SYNOPSIS
--------
*%pom_xpath_remove* [OPTIONS] XPath [XML-file-location]...

OPTIONS
-------

*-r*::
Work in recursive mode. That means that given node is also removed from
all enabled submodules of given POM file(s). Has no effect if the file is
not Maven POM.

*-f*::
Do not throw an error when one of the specified files doesn't contain
given node.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This macro patches specified POM file removing all XML nodes described
by the XPath expression. This also works on attributes and text nodes.

XPath is an expression describing a set of XML nodes to be removed
from the POM file.  It must be a properly formated XPath 1.0
expression, as described in http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/.

Maven POM files use specific XML namespace
`http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0` as default. This namespace needs to
be explicitly specified in XPath expressions by prefixing all node names
with *pom* (i.e. *pom:modelVersion*).

Many other XML formats also use namespaces which you have to explicitly
specify. This script will use the namespace prefix names from the
*xmlns* declarations in the document's root element. So if the document
begins with `<root xmlns:my="myurl.com">` you would select the root node
with XPath expression */my:root*. If the document specifies a default
namespace (eg `xmlns="myurl.com"`) use the prefix named *default* to
acces elements in that namespace.

XML location can be either a full path to the XML, or a path to the
directory containing *pom.xml* or *ivy.xml*.  If XML location is not
given then *pom.xml* or *ivy.xml* from current working directory is
used. When both *pom.xml* and *ivy.xml* are present, *pom.xml* is
processed. You can specify more file locations.

EXAMPLES
--------
*%pom_xpath_remove pom:project/pom:reporting* - this call removes
reporting section from POM in current working directory.

*%pom_xpath_remove \'ivy:configure' build.xml* - this call disables
loading of ivy configuration in build.xml file. Note the use of `ivy`
namespace which was declared in the document as
`xmlns:ivy="antlib:org.apache.ivy.ant"`.
