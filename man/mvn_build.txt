NAME
----
mvn_build - build Maven project with XMvn

SYNOPSIS
--------
*%mvn_build* [options] [-- Maven-arguments]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*mvn_build* macro builds Maven project by calling XMvn and generates
reactor structure information to be used by *mvn_install*.

By default Maven phase *verify* and goal *javadoc:aggregate* are
executed, as well as some additional XMvn-specific goals or phases.
If *-f* is specified then phase *package* is executed instead of
*verify*.  If *-j* is given then goal *javadoc:aggregate* is skipped.

Any arguments after *--* are passed directly to XMvn.  See *xmvn(1)*
for more information on availability of XMvn options.

OPTIONS
-------
*-d, --xmvn-debug*::
    Enable XMvn debugging output.  This option causes XMvn to write
    verbose debugging information to standard output.  Debugging
    information includes at least details about artifact resolution
    from system repositories.

*-f, --force*::
    Skip compilation and execution of unit and integration tests, as
    well as resolution of build dependencies with scope *test*.  This
    option causes Maven phase *package* to be executed instead of
    default phase *verify*, defines property *maven.test.skip=true*
    which disables compilation and execution of tests and causes XMvn
    to remove any project dependencies with scope *test*.

*-i, --skip-install*::
    Skip artifact installation.  This option disables generation of
    reactor structure information so that future calls to
    *mvn_install* will not result in installation of artifacts
    produced in current Maven reactor.

*-j, --skip-javadoc*::
    Skip javadoc generation.  This option skips running Maven Javadoc
    Plugin.  Useful for packages which don't want to produce Java API
    documentation.

*-s, --singleton*::
    Enable singleton packaging (one artifact per package).  This
    option causes artifacts with identical *artifactId* to be
    installed as part of the same subpackage.  This behavior can be
    further customized by adding more specific packaging rules with
    *mvn_package*.

*-X, --debug*::
    Enable Maven debugging output.  Implies *-d*.  This option causes
    Maven to write verbose debugging information to standard output.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------
*xmvn_bootstrap*::
    Run XMvn in online mode.  If *xmvn_bootstrap* RPM macro is defined
    to any value then XMvn is ran in online mode.  Otherwise XMvn is
    ran in offline mode.  Online mode of XMvn allows missing
    dependency artifacts to be fetched from remote repositories.  This
    behavior is mostly useful when bootstrapping new packages, which
    dependecies have not yet been packaged.

*_without_tests*::
	Defining this macro to any value is equivalent to *-f* option.

*_without_javadoc*::
	Defining this macro to any value is equivalent to *-j* option.
