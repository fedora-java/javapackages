NAME
----
java_remove_annotations - remove imports and annotations from Java source files

SYNOPSIS
--------
*%java_remove_annotations* [list of file paths]... -p <list of patterns>...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This macro removes import statements as well as usage of annotations from Java
source files. The does the same as *java_remove_imports* and on top of that
finds all uses of annotations and matches the content between the '@' symbol and
either ending with whitespace or with an opening parethesis '('.

In case of match, the script also removes the block of paretheses that follows
the matched annotation, if it is present.

If the file path is a directory, recursively finds all Java source files inside.
If not specified, runs in the current working directory.

*-p*::
List of patterns to be matched against found annotations. The script uses the
*string.find* function from Lua to match each found annotation against every
pattern.

EXAMPLES
--------
Example of usage:

*%java_remove_annotations -p Nullable*

Examples of patterns:

- Annotations present in Java source file:

    1) @SuppressWarnings
    2) @SuppressFBWarnings(value = {"EI_EXPOSE_REP", "EI_EXPOSE_REP2"})
    3) @org.junit.Test
    4) @org.junit.jupiter.api.Test

- Patterns used to match:

    Pattern 'SuppressWarnings' matches 1).
    Pattern 'Suppress' matches 1), 2).
    Pattern 'org[.]junit[.]Test' matches 3).
    Pattern 'Test' matches 3), 4).

    Pattern '@SuppressWarnings' does not match anything.
    Pattern 'EI_EXPOSE_REP' does not match anything.
