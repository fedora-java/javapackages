Java Packages Tools is a community project, new contributors are
welcome. The most straightforward way to introduce new features is
writing them yourself. The preferred way to request features and
report bugs is through GitHub.

The easiest way to get support is asking on IRC -- #fedora-java on
freenode. You can also write to the Fedora Java list
<java-devel@lists.fedoraproject.org> or directly to the Java Packages
Tools maintainers <javapackages-tools-owner@fedoraproject.org>.
